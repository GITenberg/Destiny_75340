<p>“My dear Miss Standen,—Now that
the arch-enemy of mankind (in
reality he is often a friend) has
deprived you of your—shall I
say foster mother? it is time
for me to say that I hope you will always
regard me as a friend, who has known you
from your earliest childhood. There are some
events in your family history which a promise
to the dead kept me from relating during
Mrs. O’Hara’s lifetime. I will acquaint
you with them fully in a few days. As a
preliminary, Mrs. Gascoigne and myself will
be delighted to have you with us while you
decide about the future. The sooner the
better. Shall we say to-day at your own time?
A house of mourning is not a suitable place for
a young girl who—although she may have
experienced much kindness—is no way
connected with the deceased. Forgive an old
lawyer’s bluntness; you are too sensible, I am
sure, to take offence at my home-truths (which
are always disagreeable). Awaiting you and
your luggage,</p>

<p>
“Believe me, my dear Miss Standen,</p>
<p class="sig1">
“Your sincere friend,</p>
<p class="sig2">
“<span class="smcap">Henry Morton Gascoigne</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>It was impossible not to believe in the
sincerity of the letter, and Muriel Standen
read it a second time with a keen sense of
gratitude for the writer.</p>

<p>She had believed herself entirely alone in
the world, penniless, and without a home.</p>

<p>For, after the death of Mrs. O’Hara, she
could no longer stay at the farm.</p>

<p>Tom was to be married in a few weeks at his
mother’s last request, and although she had
mentioned Muriel’s name, apparently with the
intention of adding something regarding her,
death had intervened.</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Hara died before the girl could
ascertain any particulars of her early life.</p>

<p>She answered Mr. Gascoigne’s letter, thankfully
accepting his kind offer, and sent it by
one of the farm-hands.</p>

<p>Then she packed her two small trunks and
said good-bye to sturdy Tom O’Hara, who said
the farm would miss her sadly.</p>

<p>“But it is not the place for a lady like you,
Miss Standen. My mother was next door to
being one, as you know, and even she detested
farm life. It was better for you when she was
here. Now you will go among your own
people, I hope. I wish I could tell you who
they are, but my mother kept her knowledge—if
she had any—to herself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, sadly. “I do not
know where I am going when I leave Mr.
and Mrs. Gascoigne. I expect that I am
quite alone in the world, otherwise my people
could hardly have left me without any sign all
these years.”</p>

<p>“If it comes to that, Miss Standen,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the big fellow strode hastily across the room
to her, “the farm’s a home to you whenever
you like to make use of it. Maggie’s a good
girl, and she would feel honoured by your
staying here.”</p>

<p>“I thank you Tom most warmly,” giving
him both her hands. “You are a kind hearted
man, and I shall never forget your generosity.
But I intend to go to London to make my living
there.</p>

<p>“I have made some enquiries, and my
voice ought to do something for me. Mr.
Gascoigne will always have my address, and
he will give me news of you now and then.
Good-bye, I must not keep your horse waiting
any longer.”</p>

<p>“I am going to drive you myself, Miss
Standen, if you will allow me. It will be the
last time.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Well, well, my dear, there is no immediate
hurry. You have scarcely been with us two
days. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Gascoigne and
myself would be only too glad if you could
make up your mind to remain with us
altogether, but I suppose you are tired of the
country.”</p>

<p>“You beggar me of gratitude,” she said,
flushing. “I have not the slightest claim
upon you and you treat me like a daughter—almost.”</p>

<p>“I wish you were now that my own are so
far away. Well, if you are determined to hear
I must tell you, sit down in that arm-chair
comfortably, and remember that a lawyer does
not like to be interrupted. At the same time
my dear, prepare yourself to hear some sad
news.</p>

<p>“Twenty years ago, your mother came to
Abbott Mansfield with you, a little child just
able to walk without falling.</p>

<p>“She rented the cottage, known as the
Laurels, which was then let furnished, and
lived there for four years with a nurse for
you and one other maid servant.</p>

<p>“She dressed always in widow’s weeds, made
no acquaintances whatever, and refused to see
any people who from kindness or curiosity
called upon her.</p>

<p>“One day I received a note asking me to go
to the Laurels.</p>

<p>“I went, and found your mother dying.</p>

<p>“The doctor said it was general weakness,
want of vitality and nervous power, and had
advised her to go to a warm climate some weeks
before.</p>

<p>“She told me it was a broken heart, my
dear.”</p>

<p>Muriel had grown white and her eyes were
dark with suppressed tears.</p>

<p>“You will find me brutally matter-of-fact.
Do not think me devoid of sympathy. Cry as
much as you like. Shall I go on?” after a few
moments pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, please.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Standen’s story was a sad one, but unfortunately,
no new thing. She had married
when very young, and, being a lovely attractive
woman, as I saw by the miniature which is in
your possession, had no lack of attention from
her husband’s friends.</p>

<p>“He was a major in the —th Hussars, a good
officer and beloved by all who knew him. Unfortunately
he trusted too much, and he trusted
Captain Ainslie absolutely.</p>

<p>“The two were the closest of friends, and
even the marriage of Major Winstanley had not
weakened their friendship.</p>

<p>“Your father was a very striking-looking
man, Miss Winstanley, I will show you a portrait
of him when I have finished, a thoroughbred
gentleman, nobility and integrity stamped
on every feature; but the captain was handsome
in the style admired by ladies—fair, with
blue eyes, a long moustache, and, no doubt,
golden hair.</p>

<p>“Your father was passionately attached to
your mother, and up to the time of your birth
they were very happy.</p>

<p>“He had a strong, stern nature, however,
and in addition to his duties, which, of course,
absorbed a good part of each day, he was fond
of literary pursuits.</p>

<p>“A man does not care the less for his wife,
Miss Winstanley, because he does not keep up
his honeymoon all his married life. Your
mother did not say that she was neglected;
but Captain Ainslie got into the habit of going
to see her every day, when, nine times out of
ten, she was alone.</p>

<p>“He was the type of man who is found in
ladies’ drawing-rooms at tea-times. Sometimes
he took her out for drives or rides, the major
trusted him entirely.</p>

<p>“When you were about a year old, Major
Winstanley was summoned to the death-bed of
his father; as the journey to the North was
long and fatiguing, he did not take his wife,
for she was not strong and from the time of
your birth had always been delicate. Four days
later, when Major Winstanley returned—”</p>

<p>The old lawyer stopped, the look on the girl’s
face was so piteous to see.</p>

<p>Her large grey eyes were wide and dark, the
sweet mouth was quivering with feeling.</p>

<p>He went up to her and took her hands in his
kindly.</p>

<p>“It is a sorry tale for young ears, my child,
but I promised a dying woman to tell you, and
to hide nothing. Cheer up a little, it ended
better than could have been hoped. Captain
Ainslie had gone off with his friend’s wife.
But Major Winstanley was a modern Don
Quixote; he traced them, followed them, and
found his wife in a Paris hotel, sobbing with
grief for her sin, the consciousness of which
could not be effaced in spite of her companion’s
attempts at consolation.</p>

<p>“Her husband went up to her and said very
quietly, ‘Marion, come home dear.’ To
Captain Ainslie he uttered one reproach,
‘What had I done to you to merit this?’ But
his heart was broken. He took his wife home,
and to the day of his death, which occurred a
month afterwards, he showed her nothing but
love and kindness.</p>

<p>“When she was left a widow, Mrs. Winstanley
found that a bank, in which most of
her husband’s money was deposited, had failed—misfortunes
never come singly—and so she
was reduced to poverty. She thereupon sold
her furniture, and came to Abbott Mansfield
with her child, changing her name to that of
Standen, for she wished to be forgotten by all
who had formerly known her. As both she
and her husband had few relations, and these
but distant ones, her object was attained. She
lived quite alone.</p>

<p>“When she knew that her days were numbered,
she sent for me and told me all the
painful story, making me take it down in
writing, to be handed to my executors in case
of my death before you became of age.</p>

<p>“By her wish I was to be her child’s
guardian, to place her in the care of some
trustworthy person, and, on her twenty-first
birthday to acquaint her with the facts; also
to hand over to her the sum of one thousand
pounds, which was all that Mrs. Winstanley
had to leave. The interest of this has been
paid to Mrs. O’Hara for her care of you.</p>

<p>“I need not tell you, my dear, that no other
person has the slightest idea of your identity—or
of this story. Here is the paper with
your mother’s signature.”</p>

<p>He handed her the document, which she
took with trembling hands, looking at the
shaking writing “Marion Orme Winstanley”
with dim eyes.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to prevent you from
burning that here in my library, if you choose.
In this box are your certificates of birth and
baptism, with your mother’s marriage papers,
so that your identity can easily be established
with my help. What do you say, my dear?”</p>

<p>“I will take your advice in everything,”
Muriel said, faintly. “You have been so
kind——”</p>

<p>“Pish! my dear. Had it not been for the
expense of having three sons and two
daughters to educate, Mrs. Gascoigne and I
would have taken you in here. They are all
out in the world now, and there is nothing to
prevent your making this your home, if you
would like it.”</p>

<p>“There is no question of liking, dear Mr.
Gascoigne; I could not be such a burden to
you. I have thought of using my voice——”</p>

<p>“As a singer? You will require at least a
year’s more training. Although Mr. Oateson
has given you invaluable help, he has not been
in London for years, and the competition is so
great that you would stand little chance at
present, free as your voice is; and then, it will
be very uphill work, my child.”</p>

<p>The old lawyer watched the girl as she
looked into the fire, her pale, delicately-cut
profile standing out against the dark marble
background of the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>“As a child, you played with the boys, and
with them you were a general favourite. You
liked them all?”</p>

<p>“Ah! how could I help it?” she said, impulsively.
“And Kitty and Madge were so
sweet with me; they were my only friends, for
I felt instinctively that Mrs. Erskine did not
wish me to go to the Rectory, and so I kept
aloof from Ethel and Dick.”</p>

<p>“If they were not so scattered about the
world, Kitty and Madge would have had you
to visit them; but India and Canada are so
far off. Reginald is coming here for a few
weeks before he goes to Melbourne to join his
brother. You know that Robert is married
out there?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I hope he is as happy as Henry is
with his wife.”</p>

<p>“I believe they are much attached to one
another. Two years ago, when Reginald came
back from Oxford, he told me of something
which may, or may not, be news to you.”</p>

<p>“To me?” the girl repeated, meeting old Mr.
Gascoigne’s keen scrutiny with amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes; he told me that, subject to my approval,
he would, when he was in a suitable
position, ask you to be his wife. Have you
never suspected this?”</p>

<p>She stood up, staring in silent astonishment.</p>

<p>“Never. I—can hardly believe it. Reginald!
We have seen so little of each other—he has
been so much away at his uncle’s.”</p>

<p>“That is the very reason why he was struck
so much with your beauty and fascination, my
dear; the others, growing up with you, had
become accustomed to both. Well—is Reginald’s
feeling for you reciprocated?”</p>

<p>The girl went up to him, and laid one hand—a
little timidly—on his arm.</p>

<p>“Do I understand that—you would sanction
it, knowing—who I am?”</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure, my child,”
returned the old lawyer, smiling. “Your
father was a major in a crack regiment, and the
daughter of such a man as Major Winstanley
is a prize for any man. Tut—tut! my dear,” as
she stammered out her mother’s name, “we
are none of us perfect. If she sinned, poor
woman, she expiated her sin.”</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed his hand, then drew
herself upright, and brushed the tears from
her eyes.</p>

<p>“You are the noblest man I have ever
known. I shall never forget your generosity—your
goodness to one who would be treated
with scorn and contumely by all who knew
her story. With all my heart I thank you and
Reginald. Please tell him and that I
appreciate the honour he does me to the
uttermost, but dear Mr. Gascoigne—I—” she
flushed scarlet, and raised her face appealingly
to his; “I—have never thought of him in that
way, only as a friend. And now that I know
who I am,” gathering strength as she went on,
“I shall never marry. You will understand
me, will you not? I must go right away—to
London, and earn my own living where no one
knows me. Mary Allen, who used to be at the
farm, is married respectably to an ex-butler,
and they let lodgings near Russell Square. I
can go there, can I not? Please do not be
angry with me, Mr. Gascoigne.”</p>

<p>“I am not angry, my dear. Think it all over
at your leisure, there is no hurry whatever for
a few days. Reginald will not be here for a
fortnight. Your money is so well invested
that it has increased to fifteen hundred pounds,
but that only means about seventy pounds a
year, and the lessons will be a consideration.
That, my dear, will be my affair; as your
guardian I insist upon it, and you will not
refuse me. And what about that paper?”</p>

<p>“I will burn it,” said Muriel, putting it into
the fire when she had again thanked him.
“And when I am successful you will let me
pay off my debt, please?” smiling sadly. “If
I am a failure——”</p>

<p>“Never despair—you have youth, beauty,
and talent; and you have a home here whenever
you like to come. By the bye, here is your
father’s portrait. His face is a very fine one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>She took it eagerly, and after a long scrutiny
kissed it passionately again and again.</p>

<p>“Captain Ainslie must have been a traitor of
the deepest dye to wrong such a friend as my
father—and he escaped scot-free,” she said, in
tones of concentrated scorn and contempt.
“No doubt he is living in happiness and
luxury, reckless of the misery he caused.”</p>

<p>“He may have really loved your mother.
For five years he led a wandering life. Of
course he left the regiment, loathed by everyone
in it. Then he married, and settled down
in the West Indies. I ascertained this myself;
but I do not know now whether he is living
or dead.”</p>

</div>


<p>A railway train is sometimes the scene of
much misery in those who travel by its carriages;
sometimes of much mirth, most often of
the assumed indifference adopted by English
people as a rule, and which, despite the contempt
with which it is spoken of by dwellers
on the Continent, is also the theme of admiration
to chatterers.</p>

<p>Two people occupying a first class carriage,
of congenial sympathies, can often while away
the tedium of several hours. If their sympathies
are opposed, they will of course entertain
mutual distrust and dislike.</p>

<p>When they are of opposite sexes, and
experienced enough to judge of character
impartially, friendships are often formed
which endure for a lifetime.</p>

<p>“I owe you many thanks for the pleasure
you have permitted me to enjoy. I looked forward
to a wearisome journey only, but you
have accepted my society, and made me your
debtor as well.”</p>

<p>“I could not help myself, you see,” smiling.</p>

<p>“But you might have frozen me up in the
true British style, and then I should have had
to wait in helpless misery for the first stopping-place.
You looked very annoyed when I got
in at Swindon.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry; but the guard was fee’d to let
me be alone if possible. Perhaps the desire of
wanting to hide yourself, to get away even
from one’s best friends, is happily strange to
you.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a little, not looking at
her.</p>

<p>Had anyone told Muriel that she would be
holding a conversation with a perfect stranger
less than an hour after she had started, she
would have repudiated the imputation with
scorn.</p>

<p>Her nature was a very proud and reticent
one, she was not given to sudden confidences.</p>

<p>But there was in her as in all natural
women—a hidden spring of impulse, and on
meeting a nature sympathetic with her own,
she almost unconsciously broke down her
guard, with the result that she and her
companion were talking as naturally as if
they had known each other for years.</p>

<p>“May I hope that you will forgive my presumption
in expressing sympathy? You are
so young to experience suffering.”</p>

<p>“I am twenty-one in years, but I feel quite
old,” she said, quietly. “I am going to London
to make my fortune—or to fail.”</p>

<p>“You have resolution enough to succeed,
but a woman has many difficulties to encounter.
And you aren’t of the calibre to be a
governess.”</p>

<p>“Never.” She shuddered a little. “I
possess no certificates.”</p>

<p>“Had you a dozen, your face and air would
debar you,” he said, with quiet courtesy.
“May one ask which of the professions you
are wishing to enter? I know a great many
people, and perhaps you may allow me the
pleasure of being of some service to you.”</p>

<p>“I thank you very much, but I am thinking
of the stage.”</p>

<p>He started, and looked at her for a moment
or two, at which she laughed, and drew farther
into her corner.</p>

<p>“Your offer of introduction had better be
withdrawn. You did not expect to hear
that.”</p>

<p>“You are right. I did not expect to hear
that,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“You think that it is a pity I have chosen
this—career?”</p>

<p>“It is fraught with many dangers, particularly
for one gently born and brought up with
luxury.”</p>

<p>“My father and my mother were; but I lost
them both in earliest childhood, and all my life
has been passed in a farmhouse amid middle-class
poverty.”</p>

<p>“But your friends? Pardon me if I am impertinent;
I do not mean to be.”</p>

<p>“I know that you do not,” she said, simply.
“My mother had changed her name, so that
no one knew me. The lawyer of the place
was appointed my guardian; he and his wife
were very kind to me, even when—” She
paused, then went on again. “I was a great
deal with them and their family, in fact, we
grew up together. They are all in the world
now, most of them married. The girls live
abroad, too far for me to visit them.”</p>

<p>“Have you made up your mind to become
an actress?”</p>

<p>“It is the only thing I am fit for. I can
sing a little; the organist at Idleminster
Cathedral was a good musician, and he trained
my voice. I used to sing the solo in the
anthems and oratorios on special occasions—hidden
behind a screen, of course. And I have
had lessons in elocution and declamation from
an actor. He knew Shakespeare and most of
the French and English dramatists by heart. I
used to listen to him for hours.”</p>

<p>“What was his name?”</p>

<p>“Gray Leighton.”</p>

<p>He started violently with excitement.</p>

<p>“Gray Leighton. You knew him well. I
have been trying to find him for four years.
You are fortunate to have had lessons from
one of the most gifted actors of the day. Did
you know his history?”</p>

<p>“No. He was crippled, and could not stand
for more than a few minutes at a time. He
came to Idleminster about four years ago, and
lived very quietly, making no friends nor ever
reciting in public. I got to know him through
his little boy. The child was very lovely. I
used to play with him, teach him music, and
take him out. His father would always trust
Bertie with me.”</p>

<p>Watching her lovely face, with its look of
sweet girl-woman’s sympathy in the deep clear
eyes, the man thought it was matter for small
wonder that a father had trusted her with his
only child.</p>

<p>“Different versions of his story will reach
your ears in London, so it is as well that you
should know the truth. Leighton’s professional
name was Lyon Fenton. His mother was an
Italian, and he inherited her southern nature.
As an actor, it is hardly too extravagant to
say that he took the world by storm. Paris,
Florence, Milan, and Vienna idolised him. He
was five-and-thirty when he came to London,
and there his slight foreign accent was the
only impediment to his success. His Romeo,
Othello, Shylock, and Hamlet were the constant
theme among critics, who almost to a
man praised him. But he did not like London
and left it after the second year for Italy. On
the eve of his marriage with a beautiful young
actress who played Juliette to his Romeo, his
<i>fiancée</i> eloped with his best friend.”</p>

<p>Muriel was listening with breathless attention,
her eyes full of indignation at his last
sentence.</p>

<p>“What horrible treachery!”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately no new thing. The girl
was duped into believing some base fabrications
about Fenton, and impetuously went off
with the man who considered nothing so long
as he attained his object. Fenton followed
them, and a duel was fought, in which he was
unfortunately wounded in the hip. His
adversary escaped, for Fenton generously fired
in the air rather than injure the man who had
married the girl he himself loved.</p>

<p>“Here you have the man’s character—erratic,
quixotic, impetuous, but noble to the
core.</p>

<p>“When the girl discovered her husband’s
treachery she poisoned him and herself, leaving
a letter for Fenton, entreating his forgiveness.
The child Bertie is theirs.”</p>

<p>Muriel drew a long breath, unconscious that
tears were trembling on her eyelashes.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said with feeling, “what a
tragedy, and all occasioned by a man’s perfidy.
The world has lost a great actor, whose
whole life is spoiled. Then Mr. Leighton is not
Bertie’s father?”</p>

<p>“He has never married; the man’s
nature is not one to change. He must
be about five-and-forty now. I knew all
this, as I was a personal friend of Fenton,
for whom I had the greatest admiration.
But when his injury necessitated his leaving
the stage, he disappeared, and none of his
former friends nor acquaintances ever heard
of him. Knowing his sensitive nature, I
understood, and did not try to find his whereabouts.
From time to time he sent me tidings,
but it is quite four years since I heard anything.”</p>

<p>“How strange it is that we should both
know him,” Muriel said, reflectively.</p>

<p>“Very. I can understand your desire for
the dramatic profession if you have been under
the spell of Leighton’s influence. He gave you
lessons, you said?”</p>

<p>“Three times a week for the last two years
and a half. I thought it wisest to prepare
myself as much as possible; but I did not like
to tell Mr. Gascoigne, the lawyer, that I was
thinking of the stage. He knows that I can
sing a little, and that I am wanting to come
out by-and-bye.”</p>

<p>“It is but a step from the vocal to the
dramatic stage,” he said, smiling a little.
Then, very gravely: “I have lived so many
years longer in the world than you, that you
will possibly permit me to give you my opinion.
For one absolutely alone in the world, as you
are, of gentle birth, you will be cruelly exposed
to fearful dangers, from which it will be
next to impossible to escape.”</p>

<p>“But I am not so very young,” she said wistfully
“and the Gascoignes will never lose sight
of me, I think. I am going to live in Bloomsbury,
with a very respectable woman and her
husband who let lodgings, and I should pay
her to accompany me to the theatre. She
used to be one of the maids at the farm.</p>

<p>“What other can I do? I have about £70 a
year of my own, which will just keep me from
starving; barely that in London, but I detest
the country. I cannot be a governess, nor
serve in a shop. Mr. Leighton has given me
two letters of introduction to the managers of
the ‘Coliseum,’ and ‘Opera Comique.’”</p>

<p>“So, then he has a very high opinion of your
powers or you would not have obtained those
introductions.”</p>

<p>“To the two best theatres, owning the most
critical of managers? But I would rather be
condemned by them than praised by the inferior
ones. Mr. Gascoigne has promised to
come up and see me in three or four weeks, and
I am to go down there for Easter. I suppose
he thinks that I shall fail.”</p>

<p>They were nearing Charing Cross by this,
and Muriel looked out at the densely packed
houses.</p>

<p>“Is this your first visit to town?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, wondering whether he would
tell her what his name was, or whether they
would never meet again.</p>

<p>“In a very short time we shall have arrived,”
he said quickly. “You will permit me to say
that I hope we shall meet as friends? Here
is my card. Please do not look at it now—I
have a reason,” meeting her look of inquiry
with a smile as he handed her the little slip of
cardboard to her. “If you will grant me permission
I will send you seats for the ‘Coliseum’
to-morrow, as I—know the manager, Mr. Harbury,
and so it is nothing. You will like to
see <i>Hamlet</i>?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed. I have the greatest
longing to see Francis Keene, and to compare
him with Mr. Leighton.”</p>

<p>“He will not bear the comparison,” her
companion smiled. “You would not, I
suppose, entertain the idea of acting as secretary
to a literary man?” he said presently.
“And possibly writing his wife’s letters as
well? I have a friend who is wanting a lady
in that capacity, and I think you would suit
him admirably, that is, if I am not too impertinent?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no; you are very kind to think of
me. How you must dislike the stage,” laughing
a little, “to endeavour to persuade even a
stranger to leave it alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>He turned to her and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“It is because I no longer think of you as a
stranger, Miss——”</p>

<p>“Winstanley,” putting her hand into his.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I will give you the address of
my friend, so that if you should care to see
him you might write in a day or two; in any
case, he would be a good person for you to
know. May I mention your name? His wife
gives ‘At Homes’ every Saturday, and you
would meet many professionals there. Here is
the address.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile I am not to know of whom I
am to think as a true friend.”</p>

<p>“Until the day after to-morrow,” smiling;
“that is if you think your landlady will
accompany you to the theatre. I imagine you
see that you have no one else at present,
though that will not be for long.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Armstrong will look rather strange—”</p>

<p>“She will not be noticed much in a box.
Here we are. What a pleasant journey it has
been. Shall I get you a
cab?”</p>

<p>And as Muriel found
herself driving to Charlotte
Street in a hansom
she thought that if all her
days in London were only
half as pleasant as this
had proved, she would
never have cause to regret
leaving Abbot Mansfield.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The “Coliseum” was
crowded as usual.</p>

<p>Nine months in the
year the cultivated and
impassioned acting of
Francis Keene drew rapt
admiration from packed
audiences, who listened to
every syllable that fell
from his firm mouth.</p>

<p>As lessee, stage-manager,
and principal actor,
he had his hands full,
and his genius for staging
a play from Shakespeare
downwards was known
throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Critics could find no
flaw in this, though they
occasionally differed about
his rendering of a part.</p>

<p>His tall, well-proportioned
figure moved easily
on the stage, and the
clearly-cut features and
musical, perfectly-trained
voice were especially fitted
for picturesque <i>rôles</i>, although
Keene was too
true an actor to adhere
to them.</p>

<p>His Shylock was as fine
as his Romeo, and King
Lear as Benedict, Othello
as Iago.</p>

<p>Down in rural little
Abbot Mansfield his name
of course was known, but
as he was particularly
averse to being interviewed and would not
allow his photographs to be exhibited in any
shop or photographer’s window, his face was
totally unfamiliar to Muriel Winstanley.</p>

<p>Even Gray Leighton had no portrait
amongst his large collection of celebrated
members of the profession.</p>

<p>Her delight at being about to witness the
finest play of the greatest dramatist the
world has ever produced, and of seeing the
great actor in his favourite part—many pronouncing
him to be absolutely unrivalled in
it—was so intense that she was strung up to
the greatest pitch of excitement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong had been with her husband
in the pit she told Muriel, and in her own
language, “he looked that beautiful, miss, but
so sad as made me quite miserable, I did want
him to ’ave ’ad the poor young lady all comf’table
at the end, and she so pretty, but it
goes contrary all through.”</p>

<p>Muriel’s black evening gown would not
attract much, if any, attention she hoped in
their box on the second tier, and Mrs. Armstrong
was, as she expressed it frequently,
that flustered at being for the first time
in such an exalted position, that she kept
well backward from observation in the intervals
between the acts.</p>

<p>It was a grand performance.</p>

<p>Keene’s theory was that <i>Hamlet</i> was a man
about thirty years of age.</p>

<p>His eccentricity and madness merely assumed
of course, and in the scene with Ophelia, his</p>

<p class="center">
“Get thee to a nunnery, go,”<br>
</p>

<p>was uttered with regretful longing rather than
peremptory harshness, great love for her was
revealed beneath the stern language, and his
last wild embrace was full of a man’s passionate
agony in parting from all that made life
worth living to him.</p>

<p>The girl sat as one entranced, drinking in
every word, not letting a single gesture escape
her keen scrutiny.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed responsively, her breath
came in gasps, she was deaf and blind to her
surroundings.</p>

<p>Once or twice Keene himself glanced up at
the beautiful sympathetic face, and his own
eyes glowed with quiet triumph.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p>“My dear, Mr. Keene was perfectly right to
advise you as he did. A man of the world’s
advice may always be taken in matters of this
sort; and a girl who lives alone is always open
to criticism, you know, even if she have no
relations.”</p>

<p>“I am singularly fortunate in my friends,”
the girl said, with a bright smile. “Mr. Gascoigne
says I was born under a lucky star.”</p>

<p>“In meeting Mr. Keene you were undoubtedly,”
Mrs. Carroll said, with a swift
look at the tall, graceful figure bending over
the escretoire; “but if you knew how many
failures Mr. Carroll and I have had in trying
to get a lady secretary, you would say that we
were the lucky people. There seemed to be no
chance of finding what we wanted. If a girl
were clever, she was vulgar or self-assertive;
if lady-like, utterly stupid, or worse still,”—laughing—“weak
and incapable of holding an
opinion. Perhaps the most objectionable type
was the girl of the period—masculine, irrepressible,
and in fact——”</p>

<p>“Full of bounce,” added Mr. Carroll,
laughing and looking up from the <i>Times</i>;
“like Miss Morton, who dictated to me instead
of taking down my ideas. I assure you, Miss
Winstanley, that she argued about every
chapter in ‘Young Calderon’s Career,’ until I
suggested that she should write a novel herself
and leave me to my own little sphere.”</p>

<p>“I wish that I knew shorthand,” Muriel
said, presently, getting paper and pens ready;
“it would be so much quicker for you.”</p>

<p>“But it entails re-writing into longhand,
whereas you get my MSS.
all ready for the printers.
No, I prefer this way; you
are the quickest longhand
writer I have ever known.
I am only afraid that just
when you get into my
ways and ‘fads’ you will
blossom into a Mrs. Siddons,
and I shall be in
misery again.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Keene is too severe
a critic, and since he has
so very kindly undertaken
to bring me out, he will
not let me do anything in
a hurry. It will be months
yet, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I hope it
will,” muttered the novelist.
“My dear,” to his
wife, “have you any letters
for Miss Winstanley
this morning, because the
sooner I can begin the
better.”</p>

<p>“Only a few more invitations
for my ‘At Home’
on the 25th,” said Mrs.
Carroll; “here is the list.
And a line to Lady Hetherington
to say that I expect
her and all her party.
I wish she were more
æsthetic in her tastes—her
friends are so often
objectionable; but it cannot
be helped.”</p>

<p>Muriel wrote the letter
and the invitations rapidly
in her clear, somewhat
eccentric, handwriting,
then handed them to Mrs.
Carroll, who passed into
the adjoining room, which
was only separated by
gracefully-draped curtains,
for the novelist and
his wife were original
enough to care for one
another after ten years of
married life, and Mr. Carroll liked to have his
dainty little wife always in view whilst he was
dictating, and even composing.</p>

<p>Her morning-room and his library were thus
in juxtaposition, and as he walked up and
down, with his notes or MSS. in his hand,
smoking an eternal cigarette or cigar, he would
catch a gleam of her golden hair, as she sat
surrounded by a pretty mass of crewel silks
and broideries.</p>

<p>Muriel got an hour or more before ten
o’clock a.m. for study, and after two o’clock
she was free, Mrs. Carroll only asking her to
accompany her in her drives and calls as a
friendly request, to be refused or accepted at
will.</p>

<p>She would drive her down to the “Coliseum”
when Mr. Keene had wished her to witness a
rehearsal; and in the evenings there were
always stalls or a box for one of the theatres,
for Muriel was to see and hear everything by
way of gaining experience.</p>

<p>She herself did not know what Mr. Keene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
had informed the Carrolls, who were his
greatest friends.</p>

<p>That Gray Leighton had so carefully trained
her in voice, gesture, manner, expression,
having the most responsive ground to work
upon, she was so well drilled in Shakespeare,
Sheridan, Molière, Racine—in fact, in the
brilliant actor’s splendid <i>repertoire</i>—that
personal experience was the one thing lacking
to develop her splendid powers.</p>

<p>She knew now that Keene and Leighton had
been friends united by the closest sympathy.</p>

<p>The older man lacked the younger’s sustaining
power, which at five-and-twenty—his age
when Leighton left England—was not at its
full zenith of course.</p>

<p>Leighton had at once perceived his young
rival’s strength, and knew that his own fame
would never be so lasting.</p>

<p>The critics had condemned a too great enthusiasm
in him, alleging that his excitable
nature led him to expend himself too soon in
a play; that, in consequence, his <i>finale</i> was apt
to be lacking in the interest felt by his
audience in the early part of the evening.</p>

<p>Keene had felt the greatest admiration, however,
for him, and
he had spoken to
Muriel as he had
thought from the
first, his own modesty
underrating
his own capabilities.</p>

<p>As a manager
he knew that he
himself had no
living equal.</p>

<p>Sparing no pains,
care, nor expense,
he searched the
world’s most remote
corners for
unique talent and
<i>objets d’art</i>, so
that he never incurred
the mortification
of reading
that his productions
were
“one-act plays.”</p>

<p>All the minor
<i>rôles</i> were as carefully
rehearsed as
his own, and the
actors in his cast,
even the very servants,
received the
most tempting
offers and larger
salaries than were
usually paid—by
outside men as inducement
to leave
the “Coliseum.”</p>

<p>“Are you ready,
Miss Winstanley?”
asked the
novelist, as Mrs.
Carroll left the
room. “I don’t mind if you stop me twenty
times; but for Heaven’s sake don’t go on too
fast and get muddled. I have only notes here,
you know. Where did we leave off?”</p>

<p>“The twins want to go to the theatre—the
Gaiety,” said Muriel, in tones of suppressed
laughter, as she read what she had written.
“‘Let’s pit it to-night,’ whispered Henry.
‘Ma’s in the humour to fork out, as the
lodgers have paid up.’”</p>

<p>“Got that? All right then,” and Mr. Carroll
began striding up and down, puffing out
smoke, and looking at his notes.</p>

<p>“‘How much are you worth?’ asked
Henrietta. ‘I’m stumped.’</p>

<p>“‘Two bob. But I shall make her give us
five, and we can go on the top of a ’bus. You
go and eat some sandwiches, and I’ll tackle
her now. She can have a flirtation with the
major all the evening.’</p>

<p>“‘Poor wretch, I pity him!’ said Henrietta.
‘Ma will talk about her poor husband until
he’ll wish himself out of it. I do want to see
the serpentine dance. It’s lovely.’</p>

<p>“‘You’ll be trying to do it with a table-cloth,
to-morrow,’ sneered Henry. ‘You’re
mad on dancing.’</p>

<p>“‘I’d rather be mad on dancing than on
lodgers,’ Henrietta answered, epigrammatically,
bouncing out of the room. ‘You get the
cash,’ she called as a parting shot.”</p>

<p>“What are you laughing at!” Mr. Carroll
asked, in surprise. “Do you find it amusing?
It is very vulgar, of course; but I assure you,
no exaggeration.”</p>

<p>“It is very wonderful to me,” Muriel said,
taking a fresh sheet of paper, “that you can
philosophise so deeply when you please, and
then put in a chapter like this—the variety
is unique.”</p>

<p>“The publishers tell me that it is what the
public like. Life is not all beer and skittles,
you know, and yet if it were, we should very
soon tire of them. There were two little
brutes who talked just like that in a place
where I stayed once in my young days.
‘Chapter thirty-four. The howl of the pessimist
is one of the signs of the times, one that
cannot be checked too strongly, for it is the
outcome of a discontent fatal to any great
achievement, and as false as it is hurtful.’”</p>

<p>A dissertation on pessimism followed, and
quotations from so many classical authors of
olden and modern time as showed that the
author knew his subject thoroughly, and was
a man of no mean understanding.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Carroll’s “At Home” promised to be a
very brilliant affair.</p>

<p>There were two ambassadors coming, the
latest social “lion,” and the most brilliant
members of the legal, literary and dramatic
professions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll had asked Muriel to go with
her to Madame Irène’s about ten days beforehand,
for she said she always felt more comfortable
if she put on her gown before a friend
whose judgment she could rely upon.</p>

<p>All innocently Muriel assented, and expressed
genuine admiration when the dainty
little woman had herself arrayed in soft, thick
brocade of the colours of almond blossom
and delicate green leaves, with some real old
lace on the bodice.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make me look too old? My husband
likes handsome materials,” she said,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais</i>, madame is <i>superbe</i>,” the Frenchwoman
said, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>“It suits you perfectly, Mrs. Carroll. Everyone
wears brocade now, and you will never
look old,” Muriel said, smiling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll gave a sigh of relief, and
then turned to inspect some white silks that
were hanging over chairs.</p>

<p>“Do you like this, Muriel?” she said, touching
one of the thickest.</p>

<p>“It would suit mademoiselle,” said Madame
Irène, looking at the delicate complexion and
the waves of deep gold hair.</p>

<p>Muriel shook her head.</p>

<p>“I am in mourning—”</p>

<p>“But you will look sweet in white,” said
Mrs. Carroll. “You must have a new gown
too. Madame, can you make one in time?”</p>

<p>And, in spite of the girl’s look of entreaty,
the little woman carried her point, laughingly
telling her as they drove home that
she had arranged it beforehand with her husband.</p>

<p>“We wanted you to look your best, and
white is so becoming for girls. Old married
people can do anything, you know,” she
added, with a bewitching little smile that
went to Muriel’s heart as she tried to thank
her.</p>

<p>Very lovely she
looked on the
night in the long
straight folds of
the perfectly-fitting
gown, with
some white moss-rose
buds fastened
at her breast.</p>

<p>They had been
sent to her anonymously,
and she
thought it was
merely another
of Mrs. Carroll’s
many kindnesses.</p>

<p>She could not
resist the pleasure
of wearing them,
although she discovered
her mistake
when she
made her appearance
in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>As soon as the
rooms began filling,
music, songs,
and recitations
succeeded each
other, there being
so many professionals
present
that there was no
danger of <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p>Muriel played
and sang, Signor
Losti, the great
master, taking a
great fancy to her
voice, and, finding
that she knew
Gray Leighton,
striking up a friendship on the spot.</p>

<p>Mr. Keene came on from the “Coliseum,” and,
heedless of fatigue, took his part amongst the
performers with the winning courtesy so often
seen in great <i>artistes</i>.</p>

<p>He said little to Muriel, seeing that she was
surrounded by a circle of admirers, until late
in the evening, when Mrs. Carroll approached
him and asked with a smile if he would give
them one more delight.</p>

<p>He smiled and went up to Muriel.</p>

<p>“Miss Winstanley, are you tired?”</p>

<p>“No,” she smiled, rising instantly, wondering
a little at his question.</p>

<p>“I want you to recite with me.”</p>

<p>“I?” starting back and turning white;
“Mr. Keene—you are cruel!”</p>

<p>“No,” he returned kindly, “I am quite sure
that you can if you will. You will not be
nervous?”</p>

<p>“Horribly—I—perhaps by myself I could,
but with the greatest actor of the day, it would
be such a terrible ordeal—”</p>

<p>“No worse than with Gray Leighton. Come
and rehearse with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Trembling, she placed her one hand on his arm
and he led her through the conservatory,
across the hall, into the library.</p>

<p>“Do not be so frightened, child. You are
positively shaking,” he said, putting one hand
on her shoulder. “Imagine that you are in
Leighton’s library in Idleminster and that I am
he. You know Beatrice’s lines in <i>Much Ado</i>?
Yes, I am sure of your memory. Take me up
in the Church Scene, Act IV. <i>Exeunt</i> Friar,
Hero and Leonato. Beatrice and Benedict are
alone.”</p>

<p>He went back a few steps to give her
time to pull herself together, then approached
her with:</p>

<p>“‘Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this
while?’”</p>

<p>For one instant only she hesitated, the
remembrance of the scene with its dawning of
passion under cover of the exquisite badinage
sending a flood of colour to her face.</p>

<p>Then she gave her answer—</p>

<p>“‘Yea, and I will weep awhile longer,’”
with trembling excitement, giving the sound
of indignant tears in the rich but wondrously
sweet tone, trained to perfection by Gray
Leighton’s sensitive ear.</p>

<p>The scene went on to its end without a
break.</p>

<p>Keene, knowing the passionate nature
of the girl woman, letting himself reveal the
great love of Benedict despite the laughing
nature, and the torrent of light jest that rolls
from his lips.</p>

<p>She rose to it, keeping well under control
even when with the confession of her love
almost unconsciously forced from her:</p>

<p>“‘I love you with so much of my heart, that
none is left to protest.’”</p>

<p>He caught her to his heart, kissing her hair
as he murmured passionately—“Come, bid me
do anything for thee.”</p>

<p>She paled, but laughed as he released her,
with sweetest witchery pelting him with taunts
until he protests:</p>

<p>“‘By this hand, Claudio shall render me a
dear account,’” and the scene ends.</p>

<p>She stood perfectly still, then swayed a
moment, falling on a chair as he went
forward.</p>

<p>Seeing the severe tension to which her nerves
were pitched, he left her again, quietly looking
over some books, but watching her covertly,
knowing she would not faint now.</p>

<p>And in a few minutes she drew a deep breath
and got to her feet again, going to him, her
eyes asking the question her lips could not
utter.</p>

<p>He took her hands in his, pressing them with
a strong close grasp.</p>

<p>“I am satisfied. You are worthy of Gray
Leighton’s tutelage. I will prove my words
soon. Meanwhile—hush, child, do not give
way now,” her features were quivering as she
read the enthusiasm in the strong, intellectual
face looking down at her so kindly. With a
great effort she forced down her emotion and
murmured, brokenly, “How can I thank
you?”</p>

<p>“By coming back with me and going
through it again before Mrs. Carroll’s guests.
You can—<i>will</i> you? You can trust yourself?”</p>

<p>“Can I, Mr. Keene? For God’s sake think—<i>can</i>
I?” she asked, looking at him with all
the anxious longing of a great soul in her
beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>He gave her his arm with a reassuring little
nod, and they entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Keene took his hostess aside and explained
in a few words. Then, turning to Muriel, led
her to the centre of the room, and simply
announced the scene.</p>

<p>She did not hesitate now.</p>

<p>Clear as a bell her laughter rang out, her
gestures full of quaint witchery, void of
ordinary theatrical assumption, her manner
that of a perfectly-bred lady as she alternately
yielded and taunted Benedict.</p>

<p>There was a storm of applause as they
finished, from every one of either sex.</p>

<p>Again and again Keene was pressed to give
an encore, but he knew that the girl had been
taxed to the uttermost for that night, and he
let her go.</p>

<p>Old Losti went up to him and muttered a
few significant words—</p>

<p>“My friend, do you know what Scott
Roberts has just said to me? Mr. Keene will
do well to transplant that diamond to the
‘Coliseum.’”</p>

<p>The actor’s eyes flashed, but he said curtly—</p>

<p>“I say nothing, for I do not know myself.
Miss Winstanley is only an <i>amateur</i> at
present.”</p>

<p>Later on when the guests had all departed
Carroll, who had been enjoying a cigar, strolled
up to Keene, who was making his <i>adieux</i> to
Muriel and his hostess.</p>

<p>“Do not hurry, Keene, have a cigar in the
library, the ladies will not object to two
smokers, and they can stand umpires.”</p>

<p>“Why?” laughed the other, as he looked
for Mrs. Carroll’s permission before lighting
up.</p>

<p>“You know the misery I have endured for
the last year with inefficient secretaries,” said
the novelist, with mock indignation; “my
hair nearly turned white with worry. You
introduce a pearl beyond price to me, and when
I begin to breathe freely—it’s perfectly
monstrous, Keene. You are going to turn her
into a Ristori, and leave me to my misery
again.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” the other rejoined, laughing;
“can I or any other man make a Ristori
out of a nonentity? Miss Winstanley’s inner
consciousness told her long ago in what
direction her talent lay, and Gray Leighton
confirmed her. I have done nothing but test
my friend’s pupil—and I find what I expected.”</p>

<p>“She is too good to be kept back,” Mrs.
Carroll said, kissing Muriel, who was flushing
and trying to escape. “Much as I regret it in
one way, for we shall be the losers, it would be
unfair to attempt to dissuade her. And you
know, Colin, that Mr. Keene told us from the
first——” she stopped, laughing. “The
mischief is out; forgive me for my indiscretion.”</p>

<p>Muriel had turned quickly to the actor, her
eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“Ah! please tell me, Mr. Keene. Did you
think—before—that I——</p>

<p>“Could act?” enjoying her confusion
quietly. “Yes, Miss Winstanley, after I had
spoken to you for half-an-hour I felt convinced
that you had a great talent for the stage; and
the more I knew you, the stronger grew my
impression. To-night you have given us all
proof, and I am sure,” with a smile at the
Carrolls, “that no one of your friends would
wish to rob the histrionic profession of one of
its future stars. Having had the advantage of
two or three years of such excellent training,
there need not be such long delay as is
necessary with a complete novice. Experience
is requisite, after which I hope you will have a
brilliant career.”</p>

<p>“Abominable!” cried Carroll. “If you were
not beyond criticism, Keene, I would get Scott
Roberts and Alex. Fraser to slate your next
production. But you stand on such a deuced
high pedestal that no one can touch you.”</p>

<p>They all laughed as the actor rose to go,
Carroll putting his arm around his shoulders as
they left the room.</p>

<p>The two had been close friends for years.</p>

</div>


<p>True to his promise, Mr. Gascoigne came up
to town and saw Muriel.</p>

<p>She had of course told him of her good fortune
in meeting with the Carrolls, and when
he saw the genuine affection they both felt for
her, and heard from the novelist how delighted
he was with his new secretary, he strongly
advised her to give up the idea of using her
voice in any way as a professional.</p>

<p>She smiled, but Mrs. Carroll told him of her
triumph with Mr. Keene, and of his sanguine
prognostications for her future, and the old
lawyer raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I have seen Francis Keene in most of his
best <i>rôles</i>. He is not the sort of man to take
a sudden fancy I should say. He is considered
one of the most relentless of managers and
sternest of critics; if he asked you to act with
him, Muriel, your future is evidently decided,
and you are to be congratulated.”</p>

<p>“We hope to keep her with us for as long as
she likes to stay. My husband is so happy
with her secretarial work that he dreads the
time when she will not have the leisure,”
Mrs. Carroll said, looking at Muriel affectionately.</p>

<p>“Well, it is of no use for me to remind you
of your promised visit to us at Easter,” Mr.
Gascoigne said, when leaving. “As things are
it would only make a break, I suppose. You
know you have only to come, child, when you
like. Let me have a wire or a letter when your
first appearance is arranged, and I will run up
to applaud you. Mrs. Gascoigne sends her
dearest love; she is, as you know, too much of
an invalid to travel. Reginald wanted to see
you very badly, but I thought I would come
alone this time. You can let him have a
message if—the wish should ever prove reciprocal,”
he added, laughing grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall not do anything for a very long
time yet,” the girl said, shaking her head,
leaving the last sentence unanswered. “As
you say, Mr. Keene is far too particular to
recommend me anywhere until I am pretty
certain not to disgrace his introduction.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>About a fortnight after Mrs. Carroll’s “At
Home,” Muriel was sitting alone in the
drawing-room one afternoon, playing some of
her favourite Chopin’s <i>nocturnes</i>.</p>

<p>It had been a wet day, and Mrs. Carroll, who
detested rain, had gone to her room to nurse a
headache.</p>

<p>The servant announced Mr. Keene, and
Muriel got up quickly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carroll is out, and Mrs. Carroll is in
her room, but I will go to her——”</p>

<p>“I came to see you, Miss Winstanley,” he
said, quietly. “Miss D’Orsay broke down
after acting last night, and the doctor says she
must go abroad at once, as her chest is very
delicate. Her understudy, Miss Cameron, is
in great trouble, for her mother is dying. I
gave her permission to go down to Bath yesterday,
and I shall be sorry to have to wire to
her for to-night.”</p>

<p>“To-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Miss D’Orsay is too ill. Besides, she
cannot speak above a whisper. Will you take
her place with me?”</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with wide open
startled eyes.</p>

<p>“<i>You ask me to act in the ‘Coliseum’?</i>” she
gasped. “Merciful Heaven! Am I dreaming?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i1" style="max-width: 101.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">“YOU ASK ME TO ACT IN THE ‘COLISEUM’?” SHE GASPED.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“No. Listen. I intend to put on ‘Much
Ado About Nothing’ in a fortnight, and after
you went through that scene with me, I
meant you to be my Beatrice. Ophelia is not
a difficult part except for the mad scene.
Your voice is so exceptionally fine that the
songs will be a great feature. If you know
the old music you know mine. Nothing is
new. Will you do it? You are word perfect,
of course? Gray Leighton was so wrapped up
in ‘Hamlet,’ that you must have often rehearsed
with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am word perfect,” said Muriel,
slowly. “I have done it many times, and I
know the music; but——”</p>

<p>She raised her eyes piteously to his face.</p>

<p>“Will you do it as a favour to me?”</p>

<p>“Can I face the audience, Mr. Keene? That
is my only fear.”</p>

<p>“Yes, or I would not ask you. I do not
count a failure at the ‘Coliseum,’” he said,
smiling. “Will you come back with me and
rehearse at once? I have all the people there,
and we have over three hours. You shall dine
at the theatre.”</p>

<p>“Then you were sure of me?” she said,
smiling in spite of herself, and the colour crept
back to her face.</p>

<p>“I felt I might rely upon your sympathy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
help,” he returned, taking her hands and
pressing them closely. “You see that I am in
a difficulty, and I am selfish enough to come to
you.”</p>

<p>“How you put things,” the girl said, flushing.
“I will do my best. I shall never dare
to look straight in front of me, and if I die for
it I will get through my part somehow.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Then there is no time to be
lost. Will you let Mrs. Carroll know and put
your hat on? You shall have some tea after
the first rehearsal.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll entered at that moment, and as
Muriel passed him, she struck a sudden attitude,
crying laughingly:</p>

<p>“Behold Ophelia of the Coliseum Theatre!”
and left the astonished novelist to receive explanation
from Keene.</p>

<p>In less than a few minutes she was back
again in a picturesque big feathered hat and
cloak, with some thick, fluffy furs round her
throat.</p>

<p>The actor’s brougham was waiting, and Mr.
Carroll put her in, promising to be at the
theatre with his wife as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Keene had remembered every detail.</p>

<p>A dressmaker was in attendance to make
alterations in the dresses.</p>

<p>Every employée was ordered to go into the
auditorium.</p>

<p>All the cast had been requested to attend for
extra rehearsal before Muriel had been
electrified by being asked to take the part.</p>

<p>There was hardly any hitch.</p>

<p>She was not only letter-perfect, but every
gesture even to stage business had been carefully
drilled in her; and her own rare receptivity
and lightning-like perception saved her
from many errors.</p>

<p>She had acted before in the little theatre at
Idleminster, but the difference from that to
the big, stately grandeur of the ‘Coliseum’ was
appalling.</p>

<p>But Keene never took his eyes off her.</p>

<p>Before going on he told her that she was to
turn to him for every direction without fear.</p>

<p>“No matter how slight your doubt, let me
know.”</p>

<p>And she obeyed him to the letter.</p>

<p>So much so that after the first rehearsal of
Ophelia’s part, he directed her to play to the
house.</p>

<p>Carroll had come down with about a dozen
friends hastily collected, and these, with the
employées, made a good appearance in the
stalls.</p>

<p>With a few directions, which were given in
an undertone, under cover of mere conversation,
the girl went through a second time.</p>

<p>“Let yourself go,” said Keene. “Don’t be
afraid.”</p>

<p>“You have acted before?” said Rivers to her,
who played Laertes. “But I have never had
the pleasure of seeing you. I fancied that—from
something Mr. Keene said—you were a
novice; but I see my error. As he approves
of course there can be no doubt of your success.
He is well pleased I know.”</p>

<p>“This is my first appearance in London,”
she said, quietly. “I have taken parts in a
little country theatre.”</p>

<p>He stared at her for a little.</p>

<p>“Then you have genius, Miss Winstanley,”
he said, with courteous respect, and Keene
approached.</p>

<p>“You have done better than I hoped. It is
needless to give you more fatigue. Go and
rest until seven. Will you dine here?” to the
Carrolls and two eminent critics who had
come down out of kindness and friendship for
Keene. “It will save you the trouble of going
back, and it is past six already.”</p>

<p>They at once accepted, and a very merry
party it was.</p>

<p>Keene took care that Muriel had a good
dinner in spite of her protestations that she
was too excited to eat, and some very especial
Mumm was produced to wish her success.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>11.30 p.m.</p>

<p>It was over.</p>

<p>The theatre was just empty.</p>

<p>Mr. Keene’s room was crowded, and Muriel’s
name was in everyone’s mouth.</p>

<p>She was a success.</p>

<p>Three times had she been called before the
curtain, trembling so that Keene had grasped
her hand tightly, and the last time almost
carried her to Mrs. Carroll who was awaiting
her in the dressing-room.</p>

<p>“Her fortune’s made!” said Scott Roberts,
as he and Alex. Fraser went to greet her when
Mrs. Carroll brought her to the green-room.</p>

<p>“As usual, Keene’s on his feet. I did not
see her bit of Beatrice the other night——”</p>

<p>“I did,” nodded Fraser. “She was delightful.
But anything like her acting to-night
has never been heard of. All in a minute,
you know. Marvellous I call it. And never
hesitated for a word.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you are pleased,” Muriel said,
simply, but flushing with pleasure at the tone
of genuine praise. “I was so horribly
frightened and nervous when I heard someone
say the house was packed that I thought I
should have made an idiot of myself.”</p>

<p>“You positively looked at the audience,”
said Carroll. “Bang into the boxes too. My
dear child, to talk of nervousness after that!
You are a fraud!”</p>

<p>“That was only when Mr. Keene was on the
stage with me. I did not feel so afraid then.”</p>

<p>“Your mad scene was quite novel. May one
ask whether your rendering was entirely
original, Miss Winstanley?” asked Alex.
Fraser.</p>

<p>But Keene came up, and laughingly pushed
him aside.</p>

<p>“Go home and write your ‘copy’ Fraser.
She has had enough of it for one night, and I
will not have her interviewed. When you
have seen her as ‘Beatrice’ on my stage you
shall hear who trained her.”</p>

<p>And by-and-bye the Carrolls took her home.</p>

<p>For one minute, as they were waiting for the
brougham and the attention of the Carrolls
was taken by some friends, Muriel turned to
the actor, who was standing close behind her.</p>

<p>“You have not criticized me,” she said, wistfully.
“Mr. Keene was I even half what you
expected? Shall I ever be good enough?”</p>

<p>He leaned down to her, speaking in her ear.</p>

<p>“I will answer your question to-morrow. I
cannot thank you to-night.”</p>

<p>Then aloud:</p>

<p>“Will you be round at five o’clock to-morrow,
Miss Winstanley, please? I should like you to
go through one or two scenes with me—a full
rehearsal will not be necessary.”</p>

<p>“I will not fail,” she said, giving him her
hand.</p>

<p>As they were driven away, Mrs. Carroll took
her in her arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>“You were simply wonderful, my dear.
Everyone was electrified, and even after the
other night I could hardly believe my eyes.
We shall lose you now.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said her husband. “She
must live somewhere, and why not with us?
And she can still help me in the mornings, eh,
my dear?”</p>

<p>“How good you are to me,” she returned,
gratefully. “Of course I will, Mr. Carroll. But
when Miss D’Orsay gets well I shall have to
wait perhaps a long time——”</p>

<p>The novelist laughed.</p>

<p>“You made a hit, my dear; your singing
alone was worth hearing. Keene was pleased,
though he said nothing; he seldom does.
Think of it. You have made your <i>début</i> on the
stage of the ‘Coliseum,’ acting with the greatest
man of the time, not as a super either but as
leading lady. I shall put you into my next
novel, and everyone will say how far-fetched
is the plot.”</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Carroll drove her down to
the theatre, saying she would return in time to
take her back to dinner.</p>

<p>As Muriel went to the green-room, Keene
came out of his own and led her in, merely
greeting her in his usual courteous way.</p>

<p>The room was empty, and the girl looked
round a little wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Am I to rehearse here instead of on the
stage?”</p>

<p>He did not answer for a moment.</p>

<p>She threw aside her wraps and stood waiting
until he approached her quite closely.</p>

<p>“I have heard from Miss D’Orsay that it is
uncertain whether she will ever be strong
enough to return to the stage,” he said distinctly,
but in low tones. “Will you accept
the position of leading lady, Miss Winstanley?”</p>

<p>She drew back a few steps, staring at him
in bewilderment, her deep eyes looking almost
dazed.</p>

<p>Then they flashed, and she ran towards him
with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>“Ah, you cannot mean it, you cannot,” she
gasped, breathing convulsively.</p>

<p>He took her hands in both his own, and
drew her towards him very gently, looking
into her eyes with such intensity that she felt
he was reading her very soul.</p>

<p>Her colour came and went with each breath.</p>

<p>She was powerless to resist the strong
magnetic influence felt by all who knew
Francis Keene.</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean it. I offer you the post for
life if you will accept it. I want you to play
Beatrice to my Benedict for all time. I have
loved you from the time of our first meeting.
Am I too presumptuous, or do you care a little
for me? When I saw my roses in your breast,
when you yielded to my caress that was inevitable
then, I fancied that my touch had
power to thrill you. Muriel—”</p>

<p>Her eyes sank beneath his, and he held her
close to his heart, stooping until his lips rested
on hers.</p>

<p>For a moment she rested so, then, with a
sudden shudder, she drew herself away.</p>

<p>“You do not know who I am,” she whispered
hoarsely. “My mother—was—guilty of
a great sin.”</p>

<p>“Do not tell me, my child,” he interrupted.
“I love you. Whoever or whatever were your
people and their doings is nothing to me.”</p>

<p>“I can never marry,” she said, clasping her
hands to her heart, and speaking with passionate
strength, “for if ever I meet a man
named Philip Ainslie I will kill him. He merits
death. If he has any descendants I will tell
them of their father’s iniquity.”</p>

<p>Keene started violently, and looked at her
with amazement in his face.</p>

<p>Then he went slowly to her, and put his
hands on her shoulders.</p>

<p>“My darling, what phantasy is this? Philip
Ainslie was my father. I am his eldest son,
Francis Ainslie. How has my father wronged
you?”</p>

<p>He never forgot the horror and misery that
his words brought into her features, nor the
pathos with which she recoiled, shuddering in
every limb.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear God! You, <i>Francis Ainslie</i>——”</p>

<p>“Keene is my theatrical name. What is it,
my child? What is the sin?” he asked, very
tenderly. “Come to me and tell me.”</p>

<p>But she shrank from him, pressing her
hands to her eyes as though to shut him out
from her sight.</p>

<p>“You—you—” she moaned. “I cannot tell
you—I cannot——”</p>

<p>With two steps he caught her in his arms,
crushing her resistance with unconscious
strength, pressing passionate kisses on her
pale, quivering lips.</p>

<p>“You love me—you cannot deny that. I
will yield you to no other, listen to no reason
that can separate you from me. By this kiss I
swear that you shall be my wife. Now tell
me,” releasing her, “what was the wrong done
by my father? What did he do. Tell me,
Muriel.”</p>

<p>White as death, she met his look and
answered faintly—</p>

<p>“He betrayed my mother and murdered my
father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Then, before he could prevent, slipped to the
ground.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life, she had
fainted.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE SHE HAD FAINTED.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>He raised her to a chair, and fetched brandy
himself, but it was some minutes before she
opened her eyes.</p>

<p>As soon as she was fully sensible he made
her drink some brandy mixed with water, fairly
pouring it down her throat.</p>

<p>Then he spoke to her, firmly holding her
hands in a strong grasp.</p>

<p>And by degrees, with her face hidden on his
shoulder, she told him the story of Ainslie’s
treachery, her mother’s weakness, and of her
father’s nobility, though it cost him his life.</p>

<p>As she finished she drew away from him and
spoke very quietly—</p>

<p>“You see that I could never be your wife.
I could not marry the son of my father’s murderer.
Do not seek to persuade me.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, my darling. My father was
not a good man. He married at one-and-twenty
my mother, a beautiful girl of seventeen,
and in two years he deserted her after
breaking her heart with his cruelty. She died
when I was little more than six years old, but
after nearly thirty years I can see her lovely
face still, with its look of eternal unhappiness.
I was educated at a monastery in Florence
until I was eighteen, and I never saw my
father’s face nor knew that he existed; he
had made no sign nor troubled himself to
know if I were living or dead. My mother’s
father had settled some money upon me,
which made me independent. When I came
to England and went to Oxford I found that
my father was living—that he had re-married.
But though I sought him out, he betrayed
such little interest in me that I left him, declaring
that he would never see me again
unless he summoned me.</p>

<p>“I carried out my own career without his aid.
His life was a very unhappy one, his second
wife was a woman who was my mother’s
opposite entirely—strong, domineering, extravagant.
He died two years ago, before I
could go to him, of a painful disease.</p>

<p>“You see, my darling, that I knew nothing
of his sin against your father—it must have
been committed whilst I was in Florence. I
will not press you now—you will require all
your strength to act to-night. In a week from
to-day I will hear your decision.”</p>

<p>And as she got up wearily he took her in his
arms and kissed her quietly with a strength
and mastery that were irresistible.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Neither by word nor look did Muriel feel
that the man with whom she acted night after
night remembered aught of their conversation
concerning her mother’s and his father’s sin,
nor of the love that he had shown to her.</p>

<p>Whatever his genius evinced to the audience—and
with Ophelia there is but little of
the tender passion to be shown—Muriel knew
that he was keeping his word to the letter,
and, woman-like, she experienced just a little
pique that it was so.</p>

<p>His courtesy was always the same, but
whether they were alone or not, his manner
showed no more warmth than was requisite for
a close friend.</p>

<p>It had been a Monday when she first acted
at the “Coliseum”; the week would be up on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Muriel grew white and embarrassed, dreading
to meet his look, yet looking forward each day
to the evening.</p>

<p>On the Saturday when the Carrolls came to
fetch her, the novelist turned to Keene.</p>

<p>“Will you drive down to Windsor with us
to-morrow? Roberts is coming, and Sir
Randal and Lady Trevelyan.”</p>

<p>“I should have been delighted,” the actor
said, cordially; “but I have to go down into
the country—to see a friend who is ill. I have
been wanting to go all the week, but Sunday
is my only day, you see.”</p>

<p>And on Monday when Muriel arrived at the
theatre, her dresser brought her a note from
Keene.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My</span> dear child,—You will find an old friend
in the green room, who is anxious to see you.
Can you go now? You had better dress first,
however.</p>

<p class="sig2">
“Yours, <span class="smcap">F. Keene</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“Who can it be?” she said to herself, telling
her dresser to be very quick.</p>

<p>And in ten minutes she was ready and
hastening to the green room.</p>

<p>Keene was there, leaning over someone lying
on a sofa.</p>

<p>He turned to greet her, and then Muriel
gave a little cry and ran forward to kneel by
the couch.</p>

<p>“You!” she said. “Oh! Mr. Leighton, this
is so delightful. I never dared to hope that
you would come to London.”</p>

<p>The picturesque-looking man, sadly worn
and wasted physically, lying back on the
cushions, gave a warm smile, and took her
hands in his.</p>

<p>“When your letter reached me, child, telling
of your success, I felt tempted to try to get to
town; but—you know my weakness and
dislike to being seen.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said softly, “I know; and,” with
a quick flush, “Mr. Keene managed it, I am
sure.”</p>

<p>“He found me out through you, child, of
course. And yesterday, Francis,” to the actor
who had left them alone, “I wonder if you
realised what it was to me to see you? It was
like old times—”</p>

<p>Keene came back and went round to the
other side from Muriel, leaning forward and
putting one hand caressingly on Leighton’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>When he spoke, Muriel knew that he was
putting stern control over himself, not letting
the emotion he felt be detected by the swift,
restless eyes that now and then lit up with all
the fire and intellect of a great actor’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>It was no light thing, the meeting of the
two men, separated by nearly ten years’
absence.</p>

<p>They had parted with Leighton in the full
zenith of his career, Keene the rising young
actor of five-and-twenty, even then considered
by old playgoers to be far in advance of all
others.</p>

<p>The one had been cut down in the prime of
his manhood, his life’s happiness seared by one
of the basest treacheries ever perpetrated by a
friend. His enthusiasm damped, his sensitive
nature shrinking beneath the blow, he could
not endure the former publicity that had
attached to his lightest action, preferring to
live in an obscure country town, away from
the torment of the world’s pity.</p>

<p>“You have reached so high a pinnacle that
the critics cannot influence, yet you will not
disdain my congratulations, Francis. You
were always greater far than I, and to your
own power you add that of unrivalled management——”</p>

<p>Keene laughingly put his hand over the
speaker’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Opinions differ, my dear Lyon. I would
give a very great deal to have the old days
revived. You worked wonders with your
pupil here. I had little or nothing to add to
your training, given at such disadvantage.”</p>

<p>“I should like to witness the performance
to-night from the front, if it can be managed.
Can you put me somewhere out of sight?”
Fenton asked; “if not——”</p>

<p>“Your chair will be placed in the stage
box,” Keene answered, softly; “no one shall
bother you. Colin Carroll—you remember
him?”</p>

<p>“The writer? Yes; a very amusing
fellow.”</p>

<p>“He has married since you knew him—a
charming little woman. I thought of asking
them to take care of you; here they are.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Gascoigne!” cried Muriel. “Mr.
Keene, you are inimitable.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” laughed Fenton. “There is
the call-boy, Francis.”</p>

<p>The Carrolls came up, and the invalid’s
chair was wheeled to the stage box.</p>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne went off to his stall, for
Keene would not run the risk of wearying
Fenton by too many faces and conversation at
first.</p>

<p>The performance went off more brilliantly
than ever.</p>

<p>Muriel, conscious of the white, worn face
watching hers and Keene’s every movement,
listening to every word, and of her old friend
straight in front of her in the stalls, was in a
fever of excitement.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed and sparkled; in the mad
scene she surpassed herself, her voice filling
every corner of the vast theatre like the chime
of silver bells, low but clear.</p>

<p>Keene was superb, and the audience
thundered such applause that he was bound to
appear after each act again and again, Muriel
also being called for with him.</p>

<p>“You will be a great actress, my dear,” Lyon
Fenton said to her afterwards. “Although
you have had every possible advantage in
going on with Keene, still an educated
audience would not tolerate mediocrity even
under such auspices. You have sympathy, you
are <i>en rapport</i> with your part and with the
people, and you are very beautiful. Go on
working hard—Keene will never let you rest;
and he is the greatest man of the time. You
like him?”</p>

<p>She coloured hotly under the swift, searching
scrutiny.</p>

<p>“My dear, you will not be offended with
me—”</p>

<p>She knelt down by the chair.</p>

<p>They were alone; and the tears trembled on
her eyelids.</p>

<p>“You know that I can never repay a tenth
part of your goodness to me,” she said, with
deepest feeling. “All my life, Mr. Fenton, I
shall pray that—even yet—you may be happy.
Without your training I could have done
nothing, and your introduction—”</p>

<p>“No, no. That was all overshadowed by
your meeting with Keene in the train. He
loved you at first sight—I know all about it,
my child. And yet there is a cloud between
you. He is very attractive to women—surely
you are not insensible to his affection and
admiration? Tell me what is the matter. I
am old enough to be your father, and, moreover,
I have one foot in the grave and the
other hovering on the brink. I believe that
you do care for him with all your strength,” he
added, putting one hand on her arm, gently,
and lifting her face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, suddenly, “I do, Mr.
Fenton. How could I help it? He was so
kind, so thoughtful, so generous; and, when
I found that he knew you so well, it was not
like speaking to a stranger.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“And so, sweetheart, you will not visit my
father’s sin upon me? I hoped that Fenton
would persuade you. Indeed,” laughing, and
turning her face up to his, “I am strongly of
opinion that he is first with you. I have got
his promise that he will live with us; so
that his last years will be happier than the
past ten have been. And the child loves you.
Are you pleased, my darling?”</p>

<p>She put her arms round his neck, and, for
the first time, laid her mouth on his with a
long passionate kiss.</p>

<p>If he had doubted the strength of her love
before, he never did after that.</p>

<p>“You are perfect, Francis. Quite perfect,”
she said, gravely. “If you do not commit
something mortal I shall be afraid of you.”</p>
